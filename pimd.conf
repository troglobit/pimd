# By default PIM will be activated on all interfaces.  Use phyint to 
# disable on interfaces where PIM should not be run.
#
# Preferences (today more commonly known as admin distance) are used by
# PIM assert elections to determine upstream routers.  Currently pimd
# cannot reliably obtain preferences and metrics from the unicast
# routing protocols, so a default preference may need to be configured
# per interface, or a global default.  In a PIM assert election the
# router advertising the lowest assert preference will be selected as
# the forwarder and upstream router for the LAN.  An admin distance of
# 101 should be sufficiently high so that asserts from Cisco or GateD
# routers are prefered over poor-little pimd.
#
# It is reccommended that preferences (admin distance) be set such that
# metrics are never consulted.  However, default metrics may also be set
# and will default to 1024.
#
# A "phyint" can be specified by either its IP address or interface name.
#
# `preference` and `metric` after "phyint" are used to configure
# manually the default preference (a.k.a. admin distance) and metric for
# the PIM Assert messages sent on that interface.  Usually you do not
# need this, but if you do, think of them like `preference` and `metric`
# defined per iif, but used by the PIM Asserts on the oifs.
#
# If you want to add "alternative (sub)net" to a physical interface,
# e.g., if you want to make incoming traffic with a non-local source address
# to appear as it is coming from a local subnet, then use the command:
#   phyint <local-addr | ifname> altnet <net-addr> masklen <len>
# XXX: if you use this command, make sure you know what you are doing!!
#
# If you want administrative scoped multicast filtering, use the
# following command:
#   phyint <local-addr | ifname> scoped <net-addr> masklen <masklen>
# This allows interfaces to be configured as an administrative boundary
# for the specified scoped address. Packets belonging to the scoped
# address will not be forwarded. To use this compile with -DSCOPED_ACL
# option (in Makefile).
# 
# The optional `local-addr` or `ifname` arguments after the "cand_rp"
# and "cand_bootstrap_router" settings specifies the local address to be
# used in the Cand-RP and Cand-BSR messages.  In case `ifname` is given
# as argument, the IPv4 address of that interface is used.  If either is
# unspecified, the largest local IP address will be used, excluding the
# phyint interfaces where pimd has been disabled.
#
# `time` after `cand_rp` specifies how often to send the Cand-RP messages.
# Its default value should be 60 seconds. Use smaller value for faster
# convergence.
#
# `group_prefix` is/are the prefix(es) advertised if cand_rp
#
# It is possible to set a static Rendez-Vous Point using the "rp_address"
# setting.  The argument can be either a unicast or a multicast address
# followed by an optional group address and optional masklen to that.
#
# New Cisco-like spt_threshold, notice rate in kbps!  Where `rate`
# specifies the minimum rate before the last hop router initiate a
# switch to the shortest path, `packets` is an alternative notation,
# `infinity` means to never switch, and `interval` specifies the
# interval for periodical testing of the threshold.  Currently,
# `interval` must be at least 5 (seconds)
#
# Interface defaults like preference/distance and metric must be set
# before the phyint section begins -- the .conf parser is not clever.
#default_igmp_query_interval    125
#default_igmp_querier_timeout   255
#default_source_preference	101  # smaller is better
#default_source_metric		1024 # smaller is better

# The phyint settings currently *MUST BE* ordered after the default
# source preference and metric settings, but before everything else.

# By default, all non-loopback multicast capable interfaces are enabled.
