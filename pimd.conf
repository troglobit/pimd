#
# By default PIM is activated on all interfaces.  Use `phyint disable`
# on interfaces where PIM should not run.  You can also use the `-N,
# --disable-vifs` command line option along with `enable` to get the
# inverse behavior.
#
# The routing protocol admin distance (or metric preference per the RFC)
# is used in PIM Assert elections to elect the forwarder of multicast.
# Currently pimd cannot obtain distance and metric from the underlying
# routing protocols, so a default distance may need to be configured per
# interface.  If left out, the default-route-distance is used for the
# phyint.  In PIM assert elections the router advertising the lowest
# preference (distance) will be selected as forwarder (upstream router)
# for that LAN.  An admin distance of 101 should be sufficiently high so
# that asserts from Cisco or GateD routers are prefered over poor-little
# pimd.
#
# It is reccommended that preferences (admin distance) be set such that
# metrics are never consulted.  However, default metrics may also be set
# and default to 1024.
#
# A phyint directive can use either the interface name, ifname, or the
# IP address.  The distance and metric settings define administrative
# distance and metric, respectively, for PIM Assert messages sent on
# that interface.  Usually you do not need this, but if you do, think of
# them like distance and metric defined on an inbound interface (iif),
# but used by PIM Asserts on the outbound interfaces (oifs).
#
# If you want to add "alternative (sub)net" to a physical interface,
# e.g., if you want to make incoming traffic with a non-local source address
# to appear as it is coming from a local subnet, then use the command:
#
#   phyint <local-addr | ifname> altnet <net-addr> masklen <len>
#
# NOTE: if you use this command, make sure you know what you are doing!
#
# If you want administratively scoped multicast filtering, use the
# following command:
#
#   phyint <local-addr | ifname> scoped <net-addr> masklen <masklen>
#
# This allows interfaces to be configured as an administrative boundary
# for the specified scoped address, or address range.  Packets belonging
# to the scoped range will not be forwarded.  Use `--enable-scoped-acls`
# flag to the configure script to activate this at build time.
#
# Both rp-candidate and bsr-candidate are enabled in the default config,
# below.  Disabling them for all PIM capable routers is a bad idea. At
# least one PIM router in the backbone must act as a bootstrap router.
# The optional local-addr or ifname arguments after the rp-candidate and
# bsr-candidate settings specify the local address to be used in the
# Cand-RP and Cand-BSR messages.  In case ifname is given as argument,
# the first IPv4 address of that interface is used.  If either is
# unspecified, the largest local IP address will be used, excluding
# phyint interfaces where PIM has been disabled.
#
# The time argument to rp-candidate specifies how often to send Cand-RP
# messages.  The default value is 30 seconds.  Use smaller values for
# faster convergence.
#
# The group-prefix setting is the prefix(es) advertised if rp-candidate.
# It is possible to set up to 255 group-prefix records.
#
# Using the rp-address setting it is possible to set a static rendezvous
# point.  The argument can be either a unicast or a multicast address
# followed by an optional group address and optional masklen to that.
#
# The spt-threshold specifies the minimum rate in kbps before the last
# hop router initiates a switch to the shortest path.  The `packets`
# argument is an alternative notation, `infinity` means to never switch,
# and `interval` specifies the interval for periodical testing of the
# threshold.  Currently, `interval` must be at least 5 (seconds)
#
# Interface defaults, like default-route-distance and -metric must be
# set before the phyint section -- the .conf parser is not clever.
#default-route-distance	  101      # smaller is better
#default-route-metric     1024     # smaller is better
#hello-interval           30       # Don't set lower than 30

# The phyint settings currently *MUST BE* ordered after the default
# source preference and metric settings, but before everything else.

# By default, all non-loopback multicast capable interfaces are enabled.
#phyint eth0 disable

# IGMP default query interval and querier timeout.  The latter should
# per RFC always be (robustness * interval) + (query-response / 2), for
# pimd this means: (3 * 12) + (10 / 2) = 41, we've rounded it up to
# honor the late Douglas Adams.  You can set it to a higher value, but
# it is not recommended to set it lower.
